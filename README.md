Nucleic acid electron density interpretation remains a difficult problem for computer programs to deal with. Programs tend to rely on exhaustive searches to recognise characteristic features. NucleoFind is a deep-learning-based approach to interpreting and segmenting electron density. Using a crystallographic map, the positions of the phosphate group, sugar ring and nitrogenous base group are able to be predicted with high accuracy.
